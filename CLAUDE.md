# FieldSight UI — Claude Memory

## What this is

FieldSight is a field-management app for construction sites (Procore/Aconex
lineage, NZ context). This repo is the **UI prototype**: pure HTML + CSS +
browser-side React (Babel transpiled in-browser, no build step). Open the
preview HTMLs directly or via `python3 -m http.server`.

The prototype's job is to validate visual language, component shape, and
interaction patterns before any backend wiring.

## Architecture · Layer Model

The codebase is organised into 7 layers, lower layers know nothing about
higher ones:

| Layer | Name | Lives in | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L1** | Design tokens | `styles/tokens.css` (CSS custom properties) + `fs-globals.js` (JS mirror) | ✅ Sprint 0 |
| **L2** | Visual language | Color palette, typography, spacing decisions — embodied in L1 | ✅ Sprint 0 |
| **L3** | App shell | `scripts/app-shell.js` + `styles/app-shell.css` (3-pane layout, drag divider, role-based nav) | ✅ Sprint 1 |
| **L4** | Base components | `scripts/components/` + `styles/components.css` — Button, Input, Card, Badge, Avatar | ✅ Sprint 1 |
| **L5** | Composite components | `scripts/composites/` — TaskCard, StatCard, Timeline, MorningBriefCard, etc. | 🟡 Sprint 2 |
| **L6** | Pages | `scripts/pages/` — Today registered; Tasks/Safety/Sites/etc. coming | 🟡 Sprint 1 partial / Sprint 3+ |
| **L7** | Interactions | Inline within components/pages — task check-off animation, micro-interactions | 🟡 Sprint 2 + Sprint 5 |

## Conventions

- **BEM**: `.fs-{block}__{element}--{modifier}` (e.g. `.fs-card__header`,
  `.fs-task-row--mine`).
- **Tokens only**: never hardcode color/spacing/font; use CSS custom
  properties from `tokens.css`. JS code reads from `window.FS.tokens`.
- **Token sync**: `tokens.css` and `fs-globals.js` are mirrored manually.
  When you edit one, edit the other.
- **Component export**: each component file IIFEs and attaches to
  `window.FieldSight.{Name}` (e.g. `window.FieldSight.Card`).
- **Pages register**: `window.FieldSight.PAGES['/route'] = { Middle, Right }`.
  AppShell looks up via `window.FieldSight.getPageForRoute(route)`.
- **Babel in-browser**: `<script type="text/babel">` is fine; JSX optional.
  Most files use `React.createElement` directly to avoid Babel parse cost.
- **Reduced motion**: respected globally via `@media (prefers-reduced-motion:
  reduce)` in `tokens.css` (~line 627). Any new animation must check too.
- **Cache busters**: bump `?v=N` query strings in preview HTMLs when shipping
  changes, so `file://` and dev servers pick up the new version.
- **No build step**: don't introduce npm/webpack/vite. The whole point of the
  prototype is to stay editable in any text editor.

## Commands

```bash
# Local preview (any of the 3)
python3 -m http.server 8765
# then open http://localhost:8765/app-shell-preview.html

# Syntax-check JS
node --check scripts/path/to/file.js

# All-in-one syntax check
for f in scripts/**/*.js; do node --check "$f"; done
```

No tests, no linter, no formatter configured. JS is plain ES2017+ (browsers
supported are evergreen).

## Design System Quick Reference

- **Primary navy** `#102A43` (Procore/Aconex lineage), **safety orange**
  `#FF6B35` accent (hi-vis construction norm).
- **Status colors split intentionally**: `blocked = magenta` (functional
  "halt") vs `overdue = red` (temporal urgency) — never reuse one for the
  other.
- **Touch targets**: 44 / 48 / 56 px (field default 48 — gloved-hand safe).
- **Typography**: Inter (sans), JetBrains Mono (code/technical IDs).
  `.type-stat` has `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` for KPI alignment.
- **Dark mode**: blue-tinted near-black surfaces; defined in `tokens.css`
  under `[data-theme="dark"]`. Sprint 6 polishes.

Detailed completed/pending/next-phase tracking lives in **`PLAN.md`**.

## Current State

- **Active branches**:
  - `claude/sprint10-prep` — Sprint 10 + Sprint 10 follow-up fixes (library
    drag/promote, today CTA + 3-panel revert, activity width cap, insights
    warning hue, onboarding route-gate). HEAD `3ecdd49`.
  - `claude/sprint11` — fast-forwarded onto `sprint10-prep` HEAD so it now
    carries **both** the Sprint 11 work (A11y axe-core gate + contrast
    tokens, XLSX partial column-mapping, Tasks cross-day audit Q-1) **and**
    every Sprint 10 follow-up fix above. The two branches currently point
    at the same tree; future Sprint 11.x work continues on `sprint11`.
- **Open PRs**: none — Sprint 10 follow-ups + Sprint 11 ready to PR when
  the user calls them. (Sprint 11's original sub-sprint commits already
  landed on `sprint10-prep` via PR #20.)
- **Next**: see `PLAN.md` §6 Next phase candidates

## Known traps & guardrails

Mirrors `PLAN.md` §3. Each is a real bug that shipped and got fixed;
re-introducing one is the most common way to break the prototype.

### Date math

- **BUG-19 NZDT**: never `new Date('YYYY-MM-DD')` (parses as UTC,
  drifts a day in NZ). Use `FS.api.todayNZDT()` /
  `FS.api.addDaysISO()` / `FS.api.folderName()`.

### Network

- **BUG-20 CloudFront SPA fallback**: a 200 with `text/html` body is
  the SPA shell, not JSON. `_fetch.js:isJsonResponse()` guards it;
  never bypass.
- **BUG-21 audio paused-ref**: don't read `audioRef.current.paused`
  — track play state in React state.

### Theming

- **JS-mirrored hex tokens bypass `[data-theme]`**. `t.surface.X` /
  `t.border.X` / `t.text.X` from `fs-globals.js` are baked
  light-mode hex. In React `style={{ ... }}` use string literals:
  `style={{ background: 'var(--surface-panel)' }}` — never
  `t.surface.panel`.
- **NavIcon SVG `var()` resolution**: `svg.setAttribute('stroke',
  'var(...)')` does **not** resolve. Use `svg.style.stroke = color`.
- **Status colour tokens are not theme-flipped** (`--color-{success,
  info, warning, danger}-{50,100}`). On dark mode their light-pastel
  backgrounds with global white text are unreadable. Pin
  foreground via `[data-theme="dark"] .fs-X { color:
  var(--color-neutral-900) }`.
- **SAFETY = red, QUALITY = blue** is the canonical semantic
  pairing across the app (`/safety`, `/quality`, `/insights`
  insights tags, badges, KPI tiles). Don't break it by re-paletting
  one of those domains. Specifically:
  - All safety-domain chart fills + tag colours pull from
    `--color-danger-700` (light) / `--color-danger-300` (dark)
    via the `--fs-tag-{slug}` and `--fs-chart-danger` tokens.
  - All quality-domain chart fills + tag colours pull from
    `--color-info-700` / `--color-info-300`.
  - **Never pair red with deep-orange in the same chart** — they
    fail at `<= 1024px` widths and confuse colour-blind viewers.
    Sprint 9.5.7's 12-hue categorical experiment failed this and
    was reverted in 9.5.8.
  - "Other" categories (subcontractors, projects, regions,
    programme tasks) are free to use varied hues from the
    `--fs-chart-{tone}` token family, since they aren't bound
    to safety/quality semantics.

### Selection / focus

- **`:focus` paints on mouse click**; produces "double-border" with
  `--selected`. Use `:focus-visible` for inset outlines.
- **`.fs-card--clickable:focus-visible` halo + `--selected`** also
  stack. Suppress halo when also selected.
- **Unified selection token**: `--surface-selected` (theme-aware) is
  the canonical "selected row bg". Don't reach for
  `--color-accent-50` directly — it reads as salmon on dark.

### Persistence / mocks

- **Don't ship UI write actions before the matching backend exists**
  (Sprint 5 lesson). Mocks lie; integration bites. Sprint 8 gates
  writes on `useMocks` and ships real PATCH/POST/DELETE shapes.

### Token / cache hygiene

- **Token sync**: `tokens.css` and `fs-globals.js` are mirrored
  manually. Edit one → edit the other.
- **Cache busters**: bump `?v=N` in preview HTMLs whenever a loaded
  `.js` / `.css` changes.

### Mobile-only floating UI clusters

- **Wrap a React.Fragment of `position: fixed` siblings in a single
  portal `<div>`** (`display: none` desktop, `display: contents`
  mobile). BottomNav was a Fragment of backdrop + sheet + nav;
  hiding only the `<nav>` left the sheet visibly leaking into the
  desktop sidebar. One container = one toggle = no gaps.

### Admin permission flow

- **Aggregator pages must explicitly fan out across all users when
  the caller is admin.** `getTimeline(date, user=null)` for
  admin returns the `available_users` disambiguation envelope, NOT
  data — naive `.map(date => getTimeline(date, null))` then drops
  every report. Pattern lives in `compliance-aggregator.fanoutDates`
  and `tasks-aggregator.getActionsResolvedRange`: when admin + no
  user, build `(date × fixtures.sites.users)` cross-product.
- **Modal `siteId` falls back to `fixtures.sites.sites[0].site_id`**
  when `state.user` is null (admin path), otherwise the modal mounts
  with `siteId=''` and silently no-ops on submit.
- **Site-aggregated timeline must union non-member contributors.**
  `AggregatedDayView` fans out `getSiteUsers × getTimeline` — folders
  enumerated by site MEMBERSHIP only. A recording site-tagged via
  pipeline G5b (`recordings.site_id`) to a non-member recorder — e.g. an
  admin who walked a site they don't belong to — is attributed to the
  site yet absent from memberships, so its topics vanish from the site
  view even though `?user=<folder>` still shows them. Fix: also fetch
  `org.getSiteContributors(site, date)`
  (`GET /api/org/sites/{id}/contributors`) and fan out over
  `members ∪ contributors`, deduped by folder. The contributors call
  degrades to members-only on failure, so a stale backend is a no-op,
  not a regression.

### Showcase

- **`components-preview.html` lag**: every new L5 composite must be
  registered there with at least a smoke render or trigger button.
  Easy to forget; check before claiming a sprint complete.

### Animation

- **Reduced motion is non-negotiable**. Every `@keyframes` needs a
  `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` override — field workers
  with vestibular disorders are a real audience.

## Working with this Project

- The user issues **specs in markdown** for each sub-sprint — patch-by-patch
  with grep-based pre-checks and a manual verification checklist. Follow
  that format when proposing new specs.
- **Ask before making architectural changes** (build tooling, framework,
  major restructure). The "no build step" constraint is intentional.
- **Don't auto-bump cache busters** unless changes touch the loaded file.
- When delivering, run `node --check` on every modified JS, `grep` the spec
  pre-checks, and confirm script load order in `app-shell-preview.html`.
- Real browser verification isn't always possible from this environment;
  state explicitly when it's done vs deferred to the user.
