# Plan — Aligning the Prototype With Backend Reality

## Context

The prototype was built (Sprints 0–2.0) before the backend's data shapes were
known. With `BACKEND-CONTEXT.md` now in hand, there is a clear mismatch
between what the UI assumes and what the API actually serves:

| Prototype assumes | Backend actually serves |
|---|---|
| `myTasks`, `teamTasks`, `urgent`, `activity`, `onSite` as parallel collections | A single `DailyReport[date, user]` containing `topics[]`, each with `action_items[]`, `safety_flags[]`, `key_decisions[]`, `related_photos[]` |
| Today as the primary surface | Daily-Report **Timeline by (date, user)** is the primary surface. Today is best modelled as a *derived* dashboard over the latest report |
| Static mock data, no auth | Cognito JWT, role-gated visibility, `/api/sites`, `/api/timeline`, `/api/transcripts`, `/api/audio-segments`, `/api/video-segments`, `/api/dates`, `/api/actions`, `/api/ask`, `/api/reports/history` |
| Tasks are first-class user-level entities | There is no user-level task list — action items live inside topics inside the daily report |
| No media model | Per-topic transcripts (with diarized speaker segments), audio segments, H264 video previews, photos |
| No calendar | Heat-map of dates with reports (`/api/dates`) |
| No Q&A | Ask Agent endpoint scoped to report or single topic |
| No archive | Daily/weekly/monthly history + regenerate |
| Single schema | Two report schemas: Daily Report (site walk) and Meeting Minutes (different field names: `owner` vs `responsible`, no `safety_flags`) |

The good news: **L1–L4 is reusable.** Tokens, atoms (Button/Input/Card/Badge/
Avatar), shell, drag divider, role/permission engine all stand. The router
already supports query params, so `/timeline?date=…&user=…` works without
router changes. The page-registry pattern accommodates new pages cleanly.

The lift is in **L5 composites + L6 pages + a new data layer**. The Today
page itself doesn't need to be thrown away — it can be re-pointed at adapters
that derive its sections from a `DailyReport`.

## Recommended approach: evolve, don't rewrite

A four-phase progression. Each phase ships independently and keeps the
preview HTMLs working.

### Phase A — Backend-shaped data layer (Sprint 2.1, ~½ day) ✅ done

Goal: stop pretending. Get the in-memory mocks shaped like real API responses
so every subsequent feature is a drop-in for the real call.

- Create `scripts/api/` with one module per endpoint, each exporting an
  `async` function that resolves a backend-shaped object after a small delay:
  - `api/sites.js`         → `getSites()`, `getSiteUsers(site)`, `getUsers()`
  - `api/dates.js`         → `getDates({ months, site })`
  - `api/timeline.js`      → `getTimeline({ date, user })`
  - `api/transcripts.js`   → `getTranscripts({ date, user, start, end })`
  - `api/audio.js`         → `getAudioSegments({ … })`
  - `api/video.js`         → `getVideoSegments({ … })`
  - `api/actions.js`       → `getActions(date)`, `toggleAction({ … })`
  - `api/ask.js`           → `ask({ date, user, question, scope, topic_id })`
  - `api/reports.js`       → `getReportsHistory(limit)`, `regenerate({ … })`
- Move existing `scripts/mock-data.js` into `scripts/mock/` and add a
  **fixtures** file `mock/daily-report.fixture.js` that returns a
  realistic `DailyReport` (with `executive_summary[]` as array, en-dash
  `time_range`, populated `topics[]`, `safety_flags`, `action_items`,
  `related_photos`, `_report_metadata`).
- Single switch `window.FS.api.useMocks = true` so we can flip to real
  `fetch` later without rewriting call sites.

Critical files:
- new `scripts/api/index.js`
- new `scripts/mock/daily-report.fixture.js`
- new `scripts/mock/dates.fixture.js`
- new `scripts/mock/sites.fixture.js`
- existing `scripts/mock-data.js` kept as a thin shim that re-exports from
  fixtures during the transition

### Phase B — Timeline page (Sprint 2.2, the big one) ✅ done

Goal: build the **missing primary surface** — `/timeline?date=…&user=…`.
This is what the backend exists to serve.

- New L5 composites in `scripts/composites/`:
  - `executive-summary-card.js` — bullet list, handles `string[]` not
    `string` (BUG-noted in backend doc)
  - `topic-card.js` — header (time_range, topic_title, category badge,
    participants), summary, expandable sections (decisions, action items,
    safety flags, photos)
  - `action-item-row.js` — checkbox + text + responsible + deadline + priority
    pill. Wraps `api/actions.toggleAction` and is keyed by
    `${topic_id}_${action_index}`. Optimistic update + revert-on-error.
  - `safety-flag-row.js` — risk-level badge (high=red, medium=amber,
    low=neutral) + observation + recommended_action
  - `category-badge.js` — `safety | progress | quality` (re-uses the
    existing Badge atom, just an opinionated wrapper)
  - `kpi-strip.js` — already exists; re-fed from report metadata
    (topic count, safety count, recordings_processed, total_words)
- New L6 page `scripts/pages/timeline.js`:
  - Middle column: header (date · user · site) → KpiStrip → ExecutiveSummary →
    list of TopicCard (collapsible), respecting BUG-19 NZDT date math
  - Right detail: TopicDetail panel (full topic + media tabs: Transcript,
    Audio, Video, Photos — each lazy-loaded)
  - Empty/no-report state: handle the three shapes — 404 JSON,
    `{ message, date }` 200 body, `{ available_users:[…] }` admin
    disambiguation
  - Content-type guard for the CloudFront SPA-fallback trap (BUG-20)
- Register at `/timeline` in `_page-registry.js`. Router already passes
  query params via `getCurrentRoute().params`.
- Add a "Timeline" item to the nav (under DAILY, between Today and
  Activity). Permission: `report:view`.

Critical files:
- new `scripts/pages/timeline.js`
- new `scripts/composites/{executive-summary-card, topic-card, action-item-row, safety-flag-row, category-badge}.js`
- edit `scripts/pages/_page-registry.js` for `/timeline` registration
- edit `scripts/fs-globals.js` NAV_ITEMS (add timeline)
- edit `styles/composites.css` for new composites
- edit `app-shell-preview.html` script loads + cache-buster bump

### Phase C — Topic-detail media (Sprint 2.3) ✅ done

Goal: when a topic is selected in the right pane, show the recordings
behind it.

- Tabs in the RightDetail when route is `/timeline`:
  - **Transcript** — speaker_segments list, jump-to-time. Note that
    `spk_0/spk_1` are not stable across files (BUG 8.6), so colour by
    *position within current view*, not globally.
  - **Audio** — segment playlist; React state via `onplay/onpause` events,
    not `audioRef.current.paused` (BUG-21).
  - **Video** — only `is_preview:true` (H264). Use `offset_sec` for
    jump-to-start. `<video preload="metadata">`.
  - **Photos** — grid of thumbnails. For each `topic.related_photos`
    filename, build `users/{folder}/pictures/{date}/{file}` and call
    `api/media.presignedUrl`. `<img loading="lazy">`. Re-fetch on modal
    re-open (15-min URL expiry).
- New composites: `transcript-list.js`, `audio-playlist.js`,
  `video-player.js`, `photo-grid.js`.

### Phase D — Today as a derived view (Sprint 2.4) ✅ done

Goal: keep the existing Today UI, but feed it from the latest `DailyReport`
for the current user instead of bespoke mocks.

- New adapter `scripts/api/today-adapter.js`:
  - `morningBrief.bullets`  ← `report.executive_summary`
  - `urgent`                ← topics where `category==='safety'` OR
    `safety_flags.length>0`, plus `safety_observations` with risk_level=high
  - `myTasks`               ← `topics[*].action_items` filtered to
    `responsible === currentUser.display_name`
  - `teamTasks`             ← rest of `action_items` (gated by role —
    workers only see myTasks)
  - `activity`              ← topics ordered desc by time_range, mapped to
    `{speaker, snippet, timeAgo, channel}`
  - `onSite`                ← `getSiteUsers(currentUser.primary_site)`
- Existing TaskCard/UrgentCard/ActivityCard/MorningBriefCard/OnSiteCard
  stay; only `today.js` swaps its data source.
- Now Sprint 2's previously-planned task check-off animation lands on
  *real* action items, with the toggle going through `api/actions`.

### Phases E – I (all shipped) ✅ done

- **E. Calendar + multi-day** — ✅ heat-mapped date picker on the
  Timeline page using `/api/dates`. Top-of-page widget toggles a
  full-month modal. (`scripts/composites/date-picker.js`,
  Sprint 2.5.)
- **F. Reports archive** — ✅ `/reports` page lists weekly/monthly
  history, presigned-URL download for `.docx`, regenerate button
  gated behind `report:create`. (`scripts/pages/reports.js`,
  Sprint 2.6.)
- **G. Ask Agent** — ✅ stateless chat strip per-topic and per-report;
  client-side history reconstruction. (`scripts/composites/ask-chat.js`,
  Sprint 2.7.)
- **H. Meeting Minutes** — ✅ separate composite set
  (`meeting-topic-card.js`, `meetings.js`, `meeting-minutes.fixture.js`)
  reading the §5.4 schema (`owner` not `responsible`, no `safety_flags`,
  decisions as objects). Daily / Meeting toggle when both exist for
  the date. (Sprint 2.8.)
- **I. Real auth + fetch** — ✅ scaffolding complete: `auth/cognito.js`
  wraps `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`, `auth/session.js` manages tokens with
  auto-refresh, `api/_fetch.js` handles 401 retry + BUG-20 +
  `_accessDenied`, every api module dispatches on `useMocks`,
  `LoginScreen` + `AccessDenied` composites land. Prototype still ships
  with `useMocks=true` — flipping false activates the real flow.
  (Sprint 2.9.)

## Concrete next step (what I'd do this week)

**Sprint 2.1 — backend-shaped data layer + fixture for Daily Report.**
Smallest viable step that unlocks everything else. ½–1 day.

Deliverables:
1. `scripts/api/` modules with mock implementations (no real fetch yet).
2. `scripts/mock/daily-report.fixture.js` — one fully populated `DailyReport`
   matching §5.1 of `BACKEND-CONTEXT.md` (3 topics, varied categories,
   action items, safety flags, photos, en-dash time ranges).
3. `scripts/mock/dates.fixture.js`, `sites.fixture.js`, `actions.fixture.js`.
4. Old `scripts/mock-data.js` becomes a shim built atop these fixtures via
   the today-adapter sketch (Phase D), so the existing Today page keeps
   rendering unchanged and we prove the adapter pattern works end-to-end
   for one surface.
5. `node --check` clean across all new files.
6. `app-shell-preview.html` cache-busters bumped.

After this sprint, **Phase B (Timeline page)** becomes a pure UI exercise
against a stable, backend-shaped contract.

## Verification

For each phase:
- `for f in scripts/**/*.js scripts/api/*.js scripts/mock/*.js scripts/composites/*.js scripts/pages/*.js; do node --check "$f"; done`
- `python3 -m http.server 8765` → open `app-shell-preview.html`
- Confirm Today still renders as before (Sprint 2.1 is non-breaking).
- For Sprint 2.2 onward: navigate to `#/timeline?date=2026-04-29&user=Jarley_Trainor`,
  open right detail, switch tabs.
- Role rotation: dev role switcher (`?dev=1`) cycles through admin / gm /
  pm / site_manager / worker; verify visibility of nav, user picker, and
  team-task vs my-task buckets at each level.
- Backend-doc traps to spot-check: NZDT date math (BUG-19), CloudFront
  HTML-404 (BUG-20), audio paused-ref (BUG-21), en-dash time_range,
  speaker label non-stability (BUG 8.6), 15-min presigned-URL expiry.

## Sprint 3 — Polish backlog (post-Phase-I review)

Items raised during the post-Phase-I review pass. Phases A–I are merged
and shipped; this section captures everything that should land in
**Sprint 5 (Flows + polish)** per the CLAUDE.md roadmap, plus a few
loose ends from the build itself. Reorder / cull as needed before
starting the sprint.

### From end-to-end UI review

- **P-01 · Urgent now: surface risk + recommended action inline.** ✅ done
  Shipped on `claude/today-polish-p01-p02`. `today-adapter.js` now
  exposes `riskLevel` + `recommendedAction` on every urgent item;
  `urgent-card.js` renders the risk pill (high/medium/low) in the
  header and the recommended action under the observation. Risk-level
  left edge supplements the badge for safety items.

- **P-02 · Recent activity: removed.** ✅ done — chose (B).
  Decision: drop the section. The data was a remap of the same topics
  on `/timeline` (which is the canonical surface), so keeping both
  diluted Today's job as a quick dashboard. Today is now: brief →
  urgent → my/team tasks → on site. `todayAdapter` still emits
  `activity` so the field is available if a future "live feed"
  iteration wants it.

- **P-03 · Left-nav collapsed: logo + chevron overlap.** ✅ done
  Shipped on `claude/nav-collapse-p03-p04`. `logoAreaStyle` switches
  to `justifyContent: center` with zero horizontal padding when
  collapsed, and the F mark is no longer rendered — only the chevron
  stays, centred in the 64 px column.

- **P-04 · Left-nav collapsed: NavItem icons drift right.** ✅ done
  Shipped on `claude/nav-collapse-p03-p04`. The active stripe in
  expanded mode still uses `borderLeft` (text-row layout, 3 px is
  fine). In collapsed mode `borderLeft` is dropped and the stripe is
  drawn via `box-shadow: inset 3px 0 0 ...` — non-layout, so icons
  centre on the row's true mid-point.

- **P-05 · Dev role switcher dropdown chrome.** ✅ done
  Shipped on `claude/polish-p05-p06`. Replaced the native `<select>`
  with a custom popover dropdown so the menu inherits the dev panel's
  translucent dark blue (rgba(20,28,45,0.98)) and the active option
  is unambiguous: accent-orange text, accent-100 background, an
  accent left stripe, and a leading ✓. Optgroup labels (Hierarchy /
  Specialists) match the original `<optgroup>` shape. Closes on
  outside click + Escape.

### Loose ends from the build

- **P-06 · Today's date is hard-coded.** ✅ done
  Shipped on `claude/polish-p05-p06`. New `FS.api.todayNZDT()` helper
  returns `YYYY-MM-DD` in `Pacific/Auckland` via `Intl.DateTimeFormat`
  (DST-correct), with a manual UTC+13 fallback for engines lacking
  the time-zone tables. `today.js` calls it on mount; if the live
  date has no report it falls back to the most recent date in
  `/api/dates` and renders a "Latest available · DD MMM YYYY" banner
  so the UI never silently anchors on a stale fixture. Effective
  date is now threaded into the TaskCard's check-off persistence
  call so toggles land on the right (date, topic_id, action_index)
  key.

- **P-07 · `window.FieldSight._todayCache` should be a Context.** ✅ done
  Shipped on `claude/internals-p07-p11`. New `TodayContext` lives in
  `today.js`; new `TodayProvider` owns the Today state via
  `useTodayState` and exposes it via context. The page registry
  gained an optional `Provider` slot — `AppShell` reads the slot and
  wraps Middle + Right in it (or `React.Fragment` for pages without
  state-sharing needs). Provider is a `Context.Provider` underneath,
  so it adds no DOM and the existing flex layout of LeftNav / Middle
  / Right is unchanged. `window.FieldSight._todayCache` writes and
  reads are gone. Visible in React DevTools, scoped per-mount, and
  the pattern generalises — any future page that wants to share
  state between Middle and Right just exports a `Provider`.

- **P-08 · Session gate not wired.** ✅ done
  Shipped on `claude/auth-gates-p08-p12`. New `SessionGate` wrapper
  in `scripts/app-shell.js` decides between `LoginScreen` and
  `AppShell` based on `FS.api.useMocks` + `FS.session.isSignedIn()`.
  Subscribes to `session.onChange` so a successful sign-in (or a
  refresh failure that clears the session) swaps screens in place.
  In mock mode it short-circuits to `AppShell` directly — no auth
  needed. `mountAppShell` now mounts `SessionGate` as the root.

- **P-09 · Meeting topic right-detail.** ✅ done
  Shipped on `claude/meeting-detail-p09-p10`. `TimelineRightDetail`
  now dispatches by `kind`: daily topics keep their full tab set
  (Overview · Transcript · Audio · Video · Photos · Ask) while
  meeting topics get a focused two-tab view (Overview · Ask). The
  meeting Overview renders the §5.4 schema verbatim — decisions
  are object cards (text + rationale + decided-by), action items
  use `owner` (not `responsible`) with the read-only caption from
  P-10, and `open_questions` are rendered as a bulleted section.
  Header carries the same time / category / participants chrome
  plus a meeting-specific status pill (decided / deferred /
  in-discussion / blocked).

- **P-10 · Meeting action items are read-only by design.** ✅ done
  Shipped on `claude/meeting-detail-p09-p10`. Caption "Read-only —
  meeting actions are tracked in the minutes, not the daily-action
  audit log." sits below the action list in both the
  `MeetingTopicCard` body and the right detail's Meeting Overview.
  Renders as a faint italic note with a left stripe so it's clearly
  a system explanation, not an action item itself.

- **P-11 · Reduced-motion audit.** ✅ done
  Shipped on `claude/internals-p07-p11`. Sweep findings:
    * `tokens.css §16` zeroes `animation-duration` / `iteration-count`
      / `transition-duration` globally under reduced-motion (belt).
    * Three named keyframes total in the codebase, each with its own
      explicit override (suspenders):
        - `fs-task-checkoff` (P-04 / 2.4)  → `animation: none; opacity: 0`
        - `fs-ask-pending`   (Phase G / 2.7) → `animation: none; opacity: 0.6`
        - `fs-btn-spin`      (pre-existing) → animation slowed to 1.6 s
    * Sprint 2.5+ added no further keyframes (DatePicker, Reports,
      Meeting Minutes, Login, AccessDenied, Sprint 3 polish — all use
      simple hover / focus transitions covered by the global rule).
  Documented as an "Animation registry" comment block at the top of
  `composites.css` so any new keyframe is checked against the same
  belt-and-suspenders rule.

- **P-12 · 403 path coverage.** ✅ done
  Shipped on `claude/auth-gates-p08-p12`. Each page-level fetch in
  `today.js`, `timeline.js`, and `reports.js` now inspects the
  response for `_accessDenied: true` and routes to a new
  `state.status === 'access_denied'` branch that renders the
  `AccessDenied` composite. Special handling in `timeline.js`:
  meeting-minutes 403 (fetched via the generic media presigner)
  is downgraded to "no meeting" rather than blocking the daily
  report — the two surfaces are independently authorised.

After P-01 through P-12, the prototype is ready for handoff to a real
auth + fetch flip (Phase I activation) without UI surprises.
